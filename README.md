# üëã Adelaide Gazdecki
### üìÅ Welcome to my portfolio. I have thoroughly documented the pinned projects.
I'm an Embedded System Design Engineer with experince building photonic and aerospace projects. I work in a vertically integrated company, so my day-to-day involvement in projects builds from initial research all the way to demonstration and deployment. This includes testing and adjusting custom PCBs, creating FPGA systems combining existing IP and RTL, creating custom embedded Linux distros, writing software targetting these systems, and supporting multiple other technical teams until even after the product is shipped.
